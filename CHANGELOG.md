        *   General helper methods within the application.

*   **Testing: Initial Phase**
    *   Conducted an initial round of functional testing on the "Enhanced Cropper" feature.
    *   Confirmed that core functionalities (loading, selecting, transforming, cropping, saving, undo) are working as expected.

### As of 2025-05-14:

*   **Feature: HEIC to JPG Converter**
    *   Successfully developed and integrated the "HEIC to JPG" tab with enhanced preview functionality.
    *   **Key Capabilities:**
        *   Batch conversion of multiple HEIC/HEIF files to JPG format.
        *   Adjustable JPG quality settings (1-100).
        *   Custom output directory selection.
        *   **New:** Interactive image preview with thumbnails.
        *   **New:** Ability to remove individual files from the conversion list via preview.
        *   **New:** Tooltips showing full filenames on hover.
        *   **New:** Improved UI with split view between file list and preview area.
        *   Automatic handling of transparency (converts to white background).
        *   Detailed status updates during conversion.
        *   Error handling for unsupported files and processing errors.
    *   **UI/UX Improvements:**
        *   Added a dedicated preview panel showing thumbnails of selected images.
        *   Included delete buttons in the preview for easy removal of unwanted files.
        *   Improved file selection and feedback mechanisms.

        *   Automatic handling of alpha channels (transparency) by pasting onto a white background.
        *   Progress tracking during conversion with real-time status updates.
        *   Detailed error reporting for any conversion issues.
    *   **Technical Details:**
        *   Uses `Pillow` with `pillow-heif` for HEIC/HEIF support.

## Future Work & Roadmap (To-Do)

The following features, corresponding to the existing placeholder tabs in the UI, need to be implemented:

1.  **HEIC to JPG Conversion:**
    *   Allow users to select one or more HEIC/HEIF files.
    *   Convert them to JPG format.
    *   Provide options for output quality and destination.

2.  **Resize Image:**
    *   Enable resizing of single or multiple images.
    *   Offer resizing by specific dimensions (pixels) or percentage.
    *   Include an option to maintain aspect ratio.
    *   Allow selection of interpolation method for quality.

3.  **Compress Image:**
    *   Allow users to reduce the file size of images (e.g., JPG, PNG).
    *   Provide controls for adjusting compression level/quality.
    *   Show estimated file size reduction if possible.

4.  **Image to Base64 Conversion:**
    *   Convert an image file into its Base64 string representation.
    *   Allow copying the Base64 string to the clipboard.
    *   Potentially allow converting a Base64 string back to an image.

5.  **WebP Conversion:**
    *   Enable conversion of images to WebP format.
    *   Enable conversion from WebP format to other common formats (e.g., PNG, JPG).
    *   Provide options for lossy/lossless WebP compression and quality settings.

6.  **Background Removal:**
    *   Implement functionality to automatically detect and remove the background from an image.
    *   This may require integrating a third-party library or API specialized for this task (e.g., `rembg`).
    *   Allow saving the image with a transparent background (e.g., as PNG).

**General Tasks for Each New Feature:**
*   **UI Design & Implementation:** Create the necessary GUI elements (buttons, labels, input fields, file dialogs) within each feature's tab.
*   **Backend Logic:** Write the Python code using Pillow (and other libraries as needed) to perform the core image manipulation.
*   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling for issues like invalid file types, processing errors, etc., and provide clear feedback to the user.
*   **User Feedback:** Update the status bar and use message boxes appropriately.
*   **Testing:** Conduct thorough unit and integration testing for each new feature.
*   **Documentation:**
    *   Update this `CHANGELOG.md` upon completion or significant progress.
    *   Add relevant sections to `README.md` describing the new feature.
    *   Write docstrings for all new methods and classes.
