Work Completed So Far
Enhanced Image Cropper Feature (Core Functionality):
We successfully developed and refined the "Enhanced Cropper" tab, which is the most complex feature implemented to date.
Key Capabilities:
Loading various image formats.
Interactive freeform cropping.
Fixed aspect ratio cropping (1:1, 16:9, 4:3, 3:2, Original) with a persistent, movable, and resizable selection rectangle (as per your preference).
Pre-crop image transformations: rotate left/right, flip horizontal/vertical.
"Undo Last Operation" functionality for both crops and transformations.
Saving the final cropped image.
Real-time display of crop area coordinates.
Application Framework & UI:
Established the main Tkinter-based GUI structure, featuring a tabbed notebook interface to house different image manipulation tools.
Included a status bar for providing feedback to you.
Comprehensive Documentation:
README.md: Updated this file to provide a thorough overview of the application, setup instructions, and a detailed description of the "Enhanced Cropper" features and usage.
image_app.py Docstrings: Added extensive docstrings to key classes and methods within image_app.py, particularly for ImageManipulatorApp and all functions related to the cropper. This significantly improves code clarity, maintainability, and understanding for future development. This was our main recent objective and is now complete.
Initial Testing:
Conducted a preliminary round of testing on the "Enhanced Cropper" feature, which you've confirmed is working okay.
Work Required to Finish the Project
To realize the full vision of the "Comprehensive Image Manipulator," we need to implement the functionality for the remaining placeholder tabs:

HEIC to JPG: Convert HEIC/HEIF images to JPG format.
Resize Image: Allow users to resize images, likely with options for dimensions, percentage, and maintaining aspect ratio.
Compress Image: Reduce the file size of images, probably with controls for quality.
Image to Base64: Convert an image file into its Base64 string representation.
WebP Conversion: Convert images to and from the WebP format.
Background Removal: A more advanced feature to automatically remove the background from an image.
